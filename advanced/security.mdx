## API Keys

API Keys are used to authenticate requests to the API. They are generated on the **API Keys** page of the [Dashboard](https://app.diarupt.ai/keys). You can create multiple API Keys for your account.
You API Keys will only be visble once when you generate them, you should copy them keep them safe & secret. Do not share them in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

## Compliance

As you move your development into production, you will need to assess and address any security and compliance requirements that may apply to your application. This will involve examining the data you are handling, understanding how our API processes data, and determining what regulations you must adhere to. You should also be in compliance with our [Terms of Service](https://diarupt.ai/terms-of-use).
