## Setup

Let's get you started building your first AI interaction in minutes in javascript.

<Tip>  
  If you prefer to jump right into the code instead, you can clone our [starter repo](https://github.com/Diarupt/examples)
</Tip>

### Get your API key

You will need an API key to authenticate your requests to our API and to use our SDKs.
You can find your API keys on your [dashboard](https://beta.diarupt.ai/manage/api-keys).

    [here](https://beta.diarupt.ai/early-access) and we'll send you an invite
    as soon as possible.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Install the SDK

Get the javascript SDK from npm or yarn.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm 
npm install diarupt
```

```bash yarn
yarn add diarupt
```
</CodeGroup>

### Add a video element
Add a video element to your html that would be used to display the AI's video feed.
  
```html index.html
...
<video id="ai-video" autoplay playsinline></video>
...
```

### Create an interaction session

You would need to create a session. A session is used to preconfigure your interaction before connecting to the AI and 
allows you to continue conversations across multiple interactions.

```javascript session.js
  import axios from 'axios';

  options = {
      /**
       * full list of available profiles can be retrieve 
       * from /faces endpoint.
       * see https://docs.diarupt.ai/api-reference/resources/get-profiles
       *  */
      profile: 'default',
      /**
       * full list of available faces can be retrieve 
       * from /faces endpoint.
       * see https://docs.diarupt.ai/api-reference/resources/get-faces
       *  */
      face: 'obama',
      context: 'Teach user everything you know about programmable matter',
  }

  const createSession = async () => {
    const res = await axios.post(
      DIARUPT_API + '/create-session',
      options,
      {
          headers: {
              'Content-Type': 'application/json',
              // TODO: Replace with your API key
              "x-api-key": 'dev-test'
          }
    })

    return res.data.session_id;
  }
```
<Warning>
  In production, you should make the session request from your backend to avoid exposing your API key.
</Warning>

### Connect to the AI
In order to connect to the AI, you would need to provide:
- the session id 
- the video element that would be used to display the AI's video feed.
- your own audio stream to enable the AI to hear you and respond.

```javascript index.js
  import {connect} from 'diarupt';
  import {createSession} from './session';

  (async() => {
    const session_id = await createSession();
    const ai_feed = document.getElementById('ai-video');
    // get the user's audio stream
    const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
     audio: {
          echoCancellation: true,
          noiseSuppression: true,
          autoGainControl: false,
      },
    });

    // starts the interaction
    await connect(
      session_id,
      {
          stream,
          player: ai_feed, // video element
      }, (event, data) => {
          // handle events
          switch (event) {
              case 'open':
                  console.log('Connection opened')
                  break;
              case 'error':
                  console.log('Connection error', data)
                  break;
              case 'close':
                  console.log('Connection closed')
                  break;
              default:
                  console.log("Unkown:" event, data)
                  break;
          }
      }
    )
  })();
```

### One last thing, disconnecting.
You'll need to disconnect the session when you're done with it.
```javascript index.js
  import {disconnect} from 'diarupt';
  stopButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    disconnect();
  });
```
<Warning>
Disconnecting an interaction let's you can continue the conversation 
by passing the same `session_id` into the SDK again. To permanently terminate your session, see [Terminate Session](https://docs.diarupt.ai/api-reference/sessions/post-terminate-session)
</Warning>

### You're ready!

Now run your code, it may takes a sec to connect and you should be able to have a conversation with your AI.
