Transcripts are a way to provide a detailed log of the interaction between the AI and the user. This is useful for debugging, post processing and for auditing purposes.

To access the intractions transcript history you can fetch a interaction session.

See the [Get Session API](/api/sessions/get-session) for more information.

An Interaction transcript history would something look like this:

```json
[
    {
        "timestamp": "2020-10-20T18:00:00.000Z",
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Hello, how can I help you?",
    },
    {
        "timestamp": "2020-10-20T18:00:02.000Z",
        "role": "user",
        "content": "I need help with my order",
    }
]
```

### Accessing Transcript During Interaction

You can also access the transcript during the interaction from the client by using the listening for the `transcript` event.
This can be useful for displaying the transcript to the user as it is being generated or for other real-time processing.

```javascript
import {connect} from 'diarupt';
...
    await connect(
        session_id,
        {
            stream,
            player: ai_feed, // video element
        }, (event, data) => {
            // handle events
            switch (event) {
                case 'transcript':
                    console.log(data);
                    break;
            }
        }
    );
...
```

That should log the transcript to the console as it is being generated, which would look something like this:

```json
{
    "timestamp": "2020-10-20T18:00:00.000Z",
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "Hello, how can I help you?",
}
```
