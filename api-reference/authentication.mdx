We use API secret keys to authenticate requests between your application and the Diarupt API. You can get an API key by logging into your Diarupt Dashboaard and navigating to the [API Keys](https://app.diarupt.ai/keys) page.

<Info>
    See the [Security Page](/advanced/security) for more information on keeping your keys safe.

You should add the `X-API-KEY` header to all requests to the Diarupt API. The value of the header should be your API key.

```bash
'X-Api-Key': '<your_api_key>'
```
